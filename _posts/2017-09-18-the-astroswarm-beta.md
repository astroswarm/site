After a few months of steady progress, I'm excited to announce the Astrolab: an astronomy computer that's now in private beta! If you're interested in a $200 device that can remotely control your telescope's autoguiding and image acquisition (and much more to come!), please read on for details, and submit the form at the bottom of this post.

## The Astrolab: a Remote Control for Your Telescope

The Astrolab is a device that connects to your telescope hardware (mount, camera, autoguider, etc.) and your local wifi network, to provide full remote control of your telescope. It differs from existing products in a few key ways:

* You don't have to forward ports, configure your router, set up DNS, or remember your IP address. Just turn on your device, head to [app.astroswarm.com](http://app.astroswarm.com), and click on it.
* It works behind almost any firewall.
* It's designed from the ground up to make use of internet connectivity and the AstroSwarm network. See below for a sneak peak about what's to come.

## Designed for an Internet-Connected World

The most important design consideration of the Astrolab is its internet connectivity and networking model. Every Astrolab that joins the network becomes a source of information for every other Astrolab on the network. This makes possible a new breed of astronomical features, such as:
 
 * Real time notifications about what you and other astronomers are looking at.
 * Collaborative observation and imaging projects that require broad geographic and hardware diversity.
 * Feed sharing of telescopes via the web and social media.
 * Super fast, cloud-based plate-solving.
 * Virtual "trading" of telescopes, so you can try out new hardware and allow others to try yours.
 * Purchase and sale of time on remote telescopes, without any minimum commitments or new software platforms to learn.
 
## What's the Difference between Astrolab and AstroSwarm?

The Astrolab is the hardware controller that plugs into your telescope and connects to the internet. It is entirely open source (both hardware and software), and permissively licensed (MIT). The Astrolab will remain 100% open source for the foreseeable future. It costs about $90 in parts to build, and I will build these myself (with no markup) for beta participants.

AstroSwarm is the web service that all the Astrolabs communicate with, contribute to, and learn from. For the duration of the beta, AstroSwarm will be free. At some point, I expect AstroSwarm to diverge into free and paid versions. The goal of AstroSwarm is to make space study as accessible and affordable as possible, but it must generate revenue in order to finance the ambitions of the platform (support, hosting, testing, hardware, and hopefully some day: dark sky real estate). AstroSwarm will always have a broad feature set available, free of charge, both to Astrolab owners and to the wider astronomy community.
